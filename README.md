# 👋 Hi, I’m @SenaKAmi

- 👀 I’m passionate about Bitcoin education and grassroots adoption across Africa, with a focus on empowering women through financial literacy and self-custody.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my knowledge in Bitcoin-only tools, circular economies, and community-driven adoption models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on meaningful Bitcoin projects, support builders working on education, community tools, circular systems, or local adoption strategies.
- 💡 I’m looking to collaborate on grants, partnerships, or experiments that align with freedom tech, local resilience, and women-led financial inclusion initiatives.
- 🌐 If you’re working on something and need help with:
– Community-building
– Strategy & execution
– Local insights
– Women-focused education
-I’d love to hear from you.🧡
